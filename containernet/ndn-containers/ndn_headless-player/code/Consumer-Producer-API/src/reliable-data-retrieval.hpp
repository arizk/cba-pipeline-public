/*
 * Two types of packet losses are possible in NDN, leading to a situation when NDN application 
 * begins to speculate about possible reasons of failed Interest/Data exchange:
 * 1) the Interest was lost in transit before it reached the data, which may reside in cache, 
 * or needs to be produced; 
 * 2) the Interest reached the producer-application and the application did not respond;
 * 3) returning Data packet was lost;
 * 4) returning Data packet could not be validated by its signature.
 * 
 * Reliable Data Retrieval protocol (RDR) uses Interest retransmission and negative acknowledgements 
 * to handle the packet losses mentioned above. Interest retransmission is activated if 
 * the expressed Interest packet is not satisfied when it times out, and in case 
 * the negative acknowledgment carrying Retry-After field was retrieved instead of the actual data.    
 *
 * Another type of transmission errors in NDN network is a failure of Data verification. 
 * Data verification error can be caused by packet tampering, content poisoning by a 
 * non-credible publisher, expired public key of a credible publisher, and other possible cases 
 * depending on the selected trust model. While Data verification operation is performed separately 
 * by a security part of the library, Data retrieval protocol will make an attempt to recover from 
 * this type of error.
 *
 * To recover from the Data verification failure, RDR performs retransmission of Interest packet 
 * with Exclude selector set to exclude any possible Data packet having the same name and the digest 
 * (e.g. hash, checksum) of the packet that has failed verification. RDR limits its exclude selector 
 * to five digests, which means that the protocol attempts up to five retransmissions in order to 
 * recover from the Data verification failure.
